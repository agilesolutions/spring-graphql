# ShowCase project for Spring Boot with GraphQL
This project is much more than what the name suggests. It demonstrates how to run Springboot microservices on a local Kubernetes cluster with Kustomize and Helm charts, integrated with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and ELK stack for logging. The project also showcases a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI/CD and FluxCD for continuous deployment.
## Demonstration Outcomes
This project aims to demonstrate the following outcomes:
- How to build, run, and deploy a Spring Boot application with various integrations and features commonly used in modern microservices architecture.
- How to protect REST endpoints using Spring Security with Oauth2.0 and JWT, how to collect and visualize application metrics using Micrometer, Prometheus, and Grafana.
- How to integrate multiple RESTful services, databases, and messaging systems using Spring Data JPA, Spring Data MongoDB, Spring Kafka, and more.
- How to validate and handle exceptions in a standardized way using Spring Validation and Controller Advice with Problem+JSON.
- How to document APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger and Spring REST Docs.
- How to test the application using JUnit, Mockito, Testcontainers, and WireMock.
- How to containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts and Kustomize.
- How to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitLab CI/CD and FluxCD for continuous deployment to Kubernetes.

## Build and Run the Application
This will Gradle build, test and package SpringBoot jar. Accordingly build a docker image, ready to get deployed to Kubernetes with Kustomize overlay local. 
Running the kubernetes manifests on the metrics directory will spin up a pre-configured Prometheus and Grafana POD. Prometheus is pre-configured to scrape the 
actuator/prometheus endpoint and absorbing SpringBoot runtime statistics.
### Build the application
```
gradle build
```
This will compile the code, run tests, and create a JAR file in the `build/libs` directory.

### Run the application
You can run the application using the following command:
```bash
gradle release # compile, test, package and docker build each microservices
kubectl apply -k ./kustomize/overlays/local # kustomize deploy gateway, client-service and account-service to local k8s cluster
kubectl apply -f ./metrics # deploy k8s deployments and services to run Prometheus and Grafana.
kubectl logs -f -n services -l app=gateway # check logs gateway service
kubectl logs -f -n services -l app=client-service # tail the logs on client-service
kubectl logs -f -n services -l app=account-service # tail the logs on account-service
kubectl logs -f -n monitoring -l app=prometheus # tail the logs on prometheus
kubectl logs -f -n monitoring -l app=grafana # tail the logs on grafana
```
Check the actuator endpoints from within the k8s cluster
```
kubectl run curl --image=appropriate/curl -n services -it --restart=Never -- sh
curl http://client-service:8080/actuator # check client-service actuator endpoint
curl http://account-service:8081/actuator # check account-service actuator endpoint
curl http://gateway:8082/actuator # check gateway actuator endpoint
```

## Security
This application is setup to securing and authorizing REST endpoints using Spring Security with Oauth2 and JWT. This application combines Authorization server, Resource Sever and Client Appication in one single application. Method level security is implemented using `@PreAuthorize` annotations. 
1. **Authorization Server** - Issues and validates OAuth2 tokens
2. **Resource Server** - Hosts protected resources requiring OAuth2 authentication
3. **Client Application** - Makes authenticated requests using OAuth2 tokens

### Architecture
This is depicting a typical OIDC Authorization Code Flow. 
1. The client requests an access token from the Authorization Server
2. The Authorization Server validates credentials and returns a token
3. The client includes this token when requesting protected resources
4. The Resource Server validates the token before serving the request

<img title="OIDC Authorization Code Flow" alt="Alt text" src="/images/oauth2_architecture.png">


### Security Testing
You need to have docker for desktop running and local kubernetes cluster started. Run the following commands to...
1. Build spring boot jar and pack in on a docker image.
2. run the kustomize local overlay to set up a k8s namespace, deployment and service binding to nodeport 30080
3. kubectl apply everything in metrics folder, k8s deploying prometheus and grafana and binding node ports.
3. run swagger UI from [http://localhost:30080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:30080/swagger-ui.html)
4. check prometheus collected metrics through [actuator/prometheus endpoint](http://localhost:30080/actuator/prometheus)
```
gradle release
kubectl apply -k ./kustomize/overlays/local
kubectl apply -f ./metrics
kubectl logs -f -n allinone -l app=allinone
kubectl logs -f -n monitoring -l app=prometheus
kubectl logs -f -n monitoring -l app=grafana
```
This application provides two sets of endpoints:
- Public endpoints: `/swagger-ui.html, /actuator, /v3/api-docs` - accessible without authentication.
- Secured endpoints: `/api/**` - require authentication and authorization Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

#### Oauth2.0 client and resource server setup
- I am faking up OAuth2 server (/oauth2/token + JWKS) issues valid RS256-signed JWTs.
- The resource server validates the JWTs using the JWKS endpoint exposed by the fake OAuth2 server.
- The client application uses the OAuth2 Authorization Code flow to obtain access tokens from the fake OAuth2 server.
- The client application includes the access tokens in the Authorization header when making requests to the resource server.
- A JwtDecoder that validates the signature, issuer, and audience of the JWTs.
- An OAuth2AuthorizedClientService that stores authorized clients in memory.
- The resource server validates the access tokens and authorizes access to protected resources based on the scopes and roles contained in the tokens (A JWKS endpoint (/.well-known/jwks.json) exposing the public key)
- The application uses method-level security annotations (e.g., @PreAuthorize) to enforce authorization rules on specific endpoints, Maps the roles claim into Spring Security authorities so @PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')") works.
- The application uses a custom UserDetailsService to load user details from an in-memory store for authentication purposes.
- The application uses BCryptPasswordEncoder to hash and verify user passwords.
- The application uses a custom JwtAuthenticationConverter to extract roles from the JWT and map them to Spring Security authorities.

#### Oauth2.0 client (OIDC authorization code grant flow)processing flow:
1. The client application initiates the OAuth2 Authorization Code flow by redirecting the user to the authorization endpoint of the fake OAuth2 server.
2. The user authenticates with the fake OAuth2 server and grants consent to the client application
3. The fake OAuth2 server redirects the user back to the client application with an authorization code.
4. The client application exchanges the authorization code for an access token by making a POST request to the token endpoint of the fake OAuth2 server.
5. The fake OAuth2 server validates the authorization code and returns an access token (a JWT signed with RS256) to the client application.
6. The client application includes the access token in the Authorization header when making requests to the resource server.
7. The resource server validates the access token and authorizes access to protected resources based on the scopes and roles contained in the token.
8. The application uses method-level security annotations (e.g., @PreAuthorize) to enforce authorization rules on specific endpoints.
9. The application uses a custom UserDetailsService to load user details from an in-memory store for authentication purposes.
10. The application uses BCryptPasswordEncoder to hash and verify user passwords.
11. The application uses a custom JwtAuthenticationConverter to extract roles from the JWT and map them to Spring Security authorities.
12. The application logs security-related events for auditing and monitoring purposes.
        
## Observability with Micrometer to collecting JVM, CPU and HTTP metrics
- JVM Memory: jvm.memory.used, jvm.memory.max, jvm.gc.pause, etc.
- CPU: system.cpu.usage, process.cpu.usage, system.load.average.1m, etc.
- HTTP Requests: http.server.requests — counts, timers, percentiles, tags by status, method, URI.
